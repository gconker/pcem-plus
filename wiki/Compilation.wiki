Compilation instructions


= Details =

To compile this project you will need Mingw, Directx sdk, openalut and a few other libraries installed. 
To make things easier you can download complete compilation enviropment for Pcem from here, as well as bios roms required to run emulator:

Just copy latest source files to /src directory .Directory with /mingw and all required libraries will be inside.

To compile debug build, use compile.bat.

To clean up object files (*.o files and others) , use clean.bat.

To compile release build , use compileRelease.bat. It will create release executable Pcem.exe (with not debug information and log) in the same directory. Same as debug build.
